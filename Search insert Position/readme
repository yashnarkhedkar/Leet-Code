Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2 => this are indexes

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1 => this are indexes

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4 => this are indexes

**IMPORTANT**
EDGE CASE
Input: [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
that's why we written s <= e
& in last of code not return s+1
