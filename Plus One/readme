Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].


Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].

Que :- why we use for loop in our code?
ans :- because let case [9,9]
       its ans is [1 0 0]
       so we used for loop 
       don't understand!!!!!!!!!! dry run krna
